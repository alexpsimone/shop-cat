## Project Proposal: shop-cat

### Overview

A collaborative wiki for vehicle repair.
This app allows users to create individual pages for different processes, with step-by-step instructions. 
Pages will be linked by keyword and moderated by the community.
The app is meant to be a better-moderated, more structured alternative to traditional vehicle forum writeups and YouTube videos.
It also provides more flexibility and collaborative oversight than a site like Instructables.

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- Wikipedia API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page
- YouTube API: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3

### Data

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User can create a new page to outline a procedure.
- User can add a list of required tools and text-based step-by-step directions.
- User will have the option to link to a relevant photo of the car/procedure.
- Text inputs will feed into a formatted display that can be read easily. 
- The user will have the option to add or remove steps after the procedure is generated for the first time.

#### 2.0

- Allow user logins.
- Allow user to edit existing steps after a procedure is generated.
- Link to the Wikipedia API to get general information about the vehicle on the page.
- User will be able to link to related videos and existing writeups on other sites.
- Allow users to flag procedures that are unclear.
- User can add a central page where all vehicles of a certain make or model are linked.
